# Password_Cracker

## The developers usually run a Hash function on your password to transform them into another form which is known as the Hash of the password. These Hash functions take your password as an input and transform them into a hash. Now if the hash of two inputs by Hash functions ( hash functions like SHA-1 ) are the same Â then it implies that the two inputs are the same. So this is how they verify whether the password you entered is right or wrong!
